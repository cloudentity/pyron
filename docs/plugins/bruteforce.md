## Brute-force protection plugin

`bruteForce` plugin protects against brute force attacks.

Enable `bruteForce` plugin with in-memory storage by adding `plugin/bruteforce` to `MODULES` environment variable.

> NOTE<br/>
> Brute-force attempts are stored locally - the attempt counters are not shared between multiple Pyron nodes.

| lockedResponse  | JSON body returned if API is locked                                                                                               |

### Example

In the above sample configuration, the max attempts is 3, so the 3rd unsuccessful attempt within the `blockSpan` period (5 seconds) will block the next attempt for `blockFor` period (10 seconds).

If before being blocked a successful attempt is made, as defined by the `successCodes` (here 200 or 201), then the failed attempts counter is reset to 0. The plugin associates the failed attempts with an entity defined in the 'identifier' block, here telling it to associate it with the `uid` in the request body.
